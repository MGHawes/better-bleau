## Better Bleau
A chrome extension to add grade and problem type breakdown charts to bleau.info!

-----

Better bleau takes the mighty website bleau.info and adds additional functionality to make it easier to find the problems and areas you want to visit.

When browsing an area page the extension will insert a chart that breaks down the problems by type (e.g. wall, traverse, overhang,...) and grade. Clicking on the chart bars will filter the problems list to only show those specific types and grades. Check out the screenshots for more details.

This is a very early version with more features to come so please do feel free to provide feedback and feature requests.
